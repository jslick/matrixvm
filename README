MatrixVM is a modular emulator.  CPUs are loaded at runtime from dynamically
linked libraries.  Hardware devices are also loaded this way (or will be in the
future).

This emulator is [currently] an interpreter emulator (as opposed to using
binary translation), and uses naive constructs to accomplish emulation.  As
such, it would not be very efficient, and would not likely perform well.  The
objective is to quickly invent new fictional architectures, some of which may
never be practical to run on hardware.

MatrixVM is meant to be cross-platform, but is not guaranteed to be so.

See BUILDING for instructions on building the emulator.
See CONTRIBUTING for developing.
See coding.txt for coding standards (mostly formatting).  Inconsistent code is
ugly code.

There is an example CPU, called basiccpu.  The emulator is currently hard-coded
to use this CPU.
